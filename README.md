## About Me
With a robust foundation in biomedical sciences and a passion for passion for data-driven problem-solving, I have honed my analytical and collaborative skills over six years at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência. My work has involved analyzing complex biological data using various statistical and computational techniques, which has deepened my interest in data science and artificial intelligence. 

Currently, I'm expanding my expertise by pursuing advanced studies in data analysis and engineering, while continuing to apply these skills in biological research contexts. I'm particularly excited about the potential of integrating life sciences knowledge with cutting-edge data science and AI techniques to address complex problems across various domains, including healthcare and biotechnology.

## Professional Experience

### Research Technician | Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)
*May 2018 - June 2024*

Part of a research group focusing on host-microbe interactions, specifically studying Drosophila melanogaster and its endosymbionts.

Key Contributions:
- Conducted a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to investigate genetic factors influencing endosymbiont levels
  - Applied advanced statistical and Machine Learning methodologies
- Managed insect populations with varied endosymbiont strains
  - Analyzed multi-generational transmission patterns
  - Developed predictive models for symbiont inheritance

### Master's Thesis Research | Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical (IHMT)
*July 2016 - December 2017*

Focused on virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, studying the interactions between viral infection and tumor suppressor genes.

Key Findings:
- Investigated alterations in splicing patterns induced by viral infection in a key tumor suppressor gene
- Discovered virus-induced changes in the activity of an important transcription factor
  - Explored the regulatory relationship between this factor and the studied tumor suppressor gene
